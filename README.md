# Reason
This repository is used for studying C++ from a very beginning.

I've came into contact with C++ since 2016, it really interested me at that time. But because of some inevitable reasons such as my poor math konwledge and less free time, I gave up it in the end.
That was a pity in total. So I decide to restart my C++ learning from now on and that's why I set up this repository
